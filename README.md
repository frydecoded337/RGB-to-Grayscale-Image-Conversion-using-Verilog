# RGB-to-Grayscale-Image-Conversion-using-Verilog-and-MATLAB
This is a Verilog program to convert a color(RGB) 3-channel image into a single channel grayscale image. MATLAB is used to convert this bitmap image into its corresponding hexadecimal values. This hexfile is then accessed by the Verilog program to carry out the arithmetic logic. The resulting grayscale file (with hexadecimal values) is then created by Verilog. MATLAB again accesses this file to convert this gray hexfile into a matrix of decimals for display.

Software used: Icarus Verilog, MATLAB

Use appropriate commands to compile and run the verilog file.
